Recursion

In your own words, what is recursion?

    Recursion is when a function can call itself. 



Why is it necessary to have a base case?

    It's always important to have a base case so that your function has a stopping point or it will keep going on which may cause an error.


Graphs

What is a graph?

    A graph is an abstract data type that:
    - can be directed our undirected
    - each graph has a set of nodes (or vertices)
    - for a directed graph these nodes are called arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines
    - for undirected graphs these nodes are called edges, arcs, or lines


How is a graph different from a tree?
    
    A graph can contain loops while a tree cannot. Relationships can be directed or undirected unlike with trees.


Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.

    Maps are good example of using graphs in computer science
